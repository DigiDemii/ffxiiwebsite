    <p class="text">Chocobo [ˈtʃoʊ.kɵˌboʊ], also called Chocob, is a recurring animal in the series. Large avian creatures, chocobos roughly act as the Final Fantasy equivalent of horses, being domesticated for use as mounts, for pulling carts and carriages and for racing. Since their first appearance in Final Fantasy II, they have appeared in every game in the series in some capacity. As a mainstay they could be considered the series's mascot.</p>

    <p class="text">This airship shares its name with the recurring summon, Leviathan. The Leviathan is the flagship of the 8th Fleet of the Archadian Imperial Army and is commanded by Judge Ghis. It is classified as a No. 1 Dreadnought class airship. It was fitted with a special type of skystone, able to resist the effects of the Jagd, which usually disables the use of airships. It was destroyed in an explosion caused by the Dawn Shard, when Judge Ghis attempted to test the shard's power by through the use of the airship's own energy source.</p>
